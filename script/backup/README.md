# Backup Scripts - WiFi Control Development History

This folder contains the various WiFi control scripts developed during the implementation process:

## Script Evolution:

1. **`wifiToggle.sh`** - Original script (causes connection issues)
   - Used `systemctl restart networking`
   - Caused TCP connection drops and routing problems

2. **`wifiToggle_safe.sh`** - First safe approach
   - Avoided full networking restart
   - Used targeted interface management
   - Still had some permission issues

3. **`wifiToggle_ultra_safe.sh`** - Enhanced safety
   - Added timeout protection for DHCP
   - Better error handling
   - Still software-only approach

4. **`wifiToggle_network_safe.sh`** - Route preservation
   - Added localhost route protection
   - Preserved default routes
   - Most sophisticated software-only approach

5. **`wifi_diagnostic.sh`** - Diagnostic utility
   - WiFi connectivity troubleshooting
   - Network state analysis
   - Still useful for debugging

## Current Active Script:
- **`wifiToggle_hardware.sh`** - Final hardware-based solution
- Location: `/script/wifiToggle_hardware.sh` (parent directory)

## Note:
These scripts are kept for reference and potential future use. The hardware-based approach in `wifiToggle_hardware.sh` is the recommended solution for production use.
